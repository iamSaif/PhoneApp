# PhoneApp
Basic phone app for test
using ionic i've made this app watching tutorials and blog posts, this app takes a username and password to login
username = "Saif"
password = "Saif123"
then it takes you to add contact page where you can add your contact, update it and delete it.
all the data is stored in local storage as per the requirement.
